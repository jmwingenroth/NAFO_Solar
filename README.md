# NAFO_Solar

The scripts in `src/` create the figures in `results/` from the USPVDB data in `data/` and the `FedData::get_nlcd()` function, which *pulls data from the  MRLC web portal* (*CURRENTLY BROKEN*).

*Note: I am currently using a local copy covering most of the USPVDB sites. Downloading the entire CONUS raster from MRLC and storing it on the L:/ drive may be a good idea in future projects.*
